"""
In this example we solve a Laplace problem with non-homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary conditions. To impose them we use Lagrange multipliers.
Note that standard FEniCS code does not easily support Lagrange multipliers,
because FEniCS does not support subdomain/boundary restricted function spaces,
and thus one would have to declare the Lagrange multiplier on the entire
domain and constrain it in the interior. This procedure would require
the definition of suitable MeshFunction-s to constrain the additional DOFs,
resulting in a (1) cumbersome mesh definition for the user and (2) unnecessarily
large linear system.
This task is more easily handled by multiphenics by providing a restriction
in the definition of the (block) function space. Such restriction (which is
basically a collection of MeshFunction-s) can be generated from a SubDomain object,
see data/generate_mesh.py
